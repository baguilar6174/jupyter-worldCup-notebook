# Sleep health and lifestyle

In this project we took the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset in where you can find data on different people such as their profession, physical activity and sleep quality. We will take this dataset to know what are the things that affect sleep such as the amount of physical activity, the profession and the pressure to which each person is subjected.
